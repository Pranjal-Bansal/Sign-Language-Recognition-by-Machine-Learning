# Sign-Language-Recognition-by-Machine-Learning

# Introduction:
This project is dedicated to the development of a machine learning model for recognizing sign language gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By training the model on a curated dataset of images representing different sign language alphabets, it aims to facilitate real-time sign language recognition and conversion of gestures into text with high accuracy.

# Objective:
The primary goal is to create a reliable and efficient model capable of accurately recognizing and converting various sign language gestures into text. This project strives to bridge the communication gap for individuals who rely on sign language as their primary means of communication.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset:

The dataset comprises images of different sign language gestures representing various alphabets. 

# Model Architecture:

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to capture the spatial hierarchies in the image data. It consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers, utilizing activation functions like ReLU and softmax to classify the gestures accurately.

# Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset. 

# Future Work:

Potential improvements include expanding the model to recognize more complex gestures, deploying the model in real-time applications, and integrating it with a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
